		<h1>HOW ODIN GOT HIS RAVENS</h1>
		<p>Once upon a time, little Odin was walking through the park with his mother and father. When his parts turned to buy some ice cream from a nearby vendor,, he ran away as quick as Thor's hammmer and hid behind a bush. When Odin was certain his parents did not know where he was, Odin wandered through the park and came upon two magnificent black ravens with their claws trapped in the grasp of some shiny ribbons that someone had mysteriously tied to the park bench.</p>

		<h3>ODIN OFFERS ASSISTANCE</h3>
		<p>Odin was apalled but what he saw. The birds, black as night and shiny as a twinkling star, were trying to leap away from the table but each attempt only pulled them deeper into the trap. Odin ran to them.</p>
		<p>"Wee little birds," he said, "is there any way a wee lad like me can help ye?"</p>

		<h5>THE BIRDS REJECT ODIN'S OFFER FOR ASSISTANCE</h5>
		<p>"Twist off!" said one of the birds. "We don't need no 'elp from the likes of you!"</p>
		<p>"Now now," chided the other, "We shan't lose our cool just because we are stuck like sitting ducks in this shiny twine and our lives are most likely going to end as a result of our vulnerability! We thank you small one but I think we should ne able to handle this."</p>

		<h2>ODIN WALK'S AWAY GUILT FREE KNOWING HE HAS DONE HIS BEST</h2>
		<p>"Oh, okay then!" Odin said as he walked away</p>

		<h4>A PREDATOR APPEARS</h4>
		<p>When Odin had walked about ten feet away a mythical lirhirow walked up to the birds from behind some bushes. The four legged beast was ten feet tall with the mane of a lion, the nose of a rhinocerous, and the wings of a tiny sparrow. The animal could not fly very far at all but could swallow the ravens in one bite.</p>
		<p>"Well well well," the predator said, licking his rather histerically at the sight of two scrawny birds. "It looks like poppy will get his fill tonight after all."</p>

		<h6>THE RAVENS BEG FOR THEIR LIVES</h6>
		<p>"OH GREAT ODIN'S RAVENS WE ARE GOING TO DIE!" screamed the panicked bird from before. The collected bird slapped him over the head.</p>
		<p>"Get yourself together Tom!" he crowed.</p>
		<p>"He is right you know," the lirhirow said. He looked slightly amused, a look that lirhirow's the world over were famous for. The truth was that the amused expression meant certain death.</p>
		<p>"Please sir. We wouldn't taste very good at all," the raven said.</p>
		<p>"Why's that?"</p>
		<p>"Well, we are crows..." the monster grinned, which meant they were seconds from death. "And you know what they say about eating crows, right?"</p>
		<p>The subject of a thoudand songs and legends shook his head.</p>
		<p>"Well... they don't taste very good."</p>
		<p>"Look," the lirhirow said, "how can I trust your opinion on the matter? You are quite obviously biased." Then he took a step toward the trapped birds, who squawked and tried to plap even my furiously away.</p>
		<p>"Tell him about crowsb4bros.com!" the formerly panicked crow name Tom said. It was his first great thought of the evening.</p>
		<p>"Yeah yeah yeah! Check <a href="http://crowsb4bros.com"> crowsb4bros </a>. They are all unbiased reviews!"</p>
		<p>The lirhirow sat on his hind legs and pulled out a smart phone from under one tiny wing.</p>
		<p>"Hmmm," he said. "I see what you mean. You really are quite foul."</p>
		<p>The two birds looked at each other as the lirhirow stalked away.</p>
